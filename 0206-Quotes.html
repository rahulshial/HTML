        <p>HTML has evolved over time.</p>

        <p>If you’re familiar at all with computer formats, this is very surprising. If you tried to open a Word processing document from the same time as when Tim Berners-Lee was creating the World Wide Web project, good luck. You’d probably have to run some emulation just to get the thing open. And yet you could open an HTML document from back then in a browser today.</p>

        <p>The original HTML will work just fine in today's browsers. And today's HTML will be accepted by early browsers. A few things might render differently, but the page will still render.</p>
